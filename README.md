# spotify4s
Early stage *Spotify* client with the *Typelevel* stack.  

This client is using the library [fsclient](https://github.com/bartholomews/fsclient)
which is an oAuth wrapper on top of [sttp](https://sttp.softwaremill.com/en/stable)

## Endpoints Task list

See [ENDPOINTS.md](https://github.com/bartholomews/spotify4s/blob/master/ENDPOINTS.md)

## Refined types

This client is using [refined](https://github.com/fthomas/refined) in order to enforce type safety on some request parameters.   
It also provides validators out of the box to make its usage a bit easier:
```scala
import cats.data.NonEmptyList
import cats.data.NonEmptyList.fromListUnsafe
import io.bartholomews.spotify4s.api.SpotifyApi.SpotifyUris
import io.bartholomews.spotify4s.entities.SpotifyUri

// type SpotifyUris = Refined[NonEmptyList[SpotifyUri], MaxSize[100]]

val ex1: Either[String, SpotifyUris] = SpotifyUri.fromList(List.empty)
assert(ex1 == Left("Predicate failed: need to provide at least one uri."))

val tooManyUris: NonEmptyList[SpotifyUri] = NonEmptyList.fromListUnsafe(
  (1 to 101).map(_ => SpotifyUri("just one extra uri...")).toList
) 

val ex2: Either[String, SpotifyUris] = SpotifyUri.fromNel(tooManyUris)
assert(ex2 == Left("Predicate failed: a maximum of 100 uris can be set in one request."))
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project is using [sbt-ci-release](https://github.com/olafurpg/sbt-ci-release) plugin:
 - Every push to master will trigger a snapshot release.  
 - In order to trigger a regular release you need to push a tag:
 
    ```bash
    ./scripts/release.sh v1.0.0
    ```
 
 - If for some reason you need to replace an older version (e.g. the release stage failed):
 
    ```bash
    TAG=v1.0.0
    git push --delete origin ${TAG} && git tag --delete ${TAG} \
    && ./scripts/release.sh ${TAG}
    ```
